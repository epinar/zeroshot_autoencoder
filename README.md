# zeroshot_autoencoder
Autoencoder based zero-shot learning model

This repo consists of autoencoder models for visual and word embeddings. 
Datasets created for this project are not included in this repo. 

There are two jupyter notebook files:
1. AE-Zeroshot : Demonstrates the usage of autoencoder model, along with the training, zero-shot testing and evaluation.
2. AWA-Explore: An exploration of Animals With Attributes dataset, each attribute are classified according to the visual embeddings and the word embeddings separately. Then they are compared.
